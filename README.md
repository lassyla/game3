# Cat Pat

Author: Alyssa Lee

Design: Switch between different hand movements and perform actions to the beat of the music! 

Note: I wanted to make this game more interesting by having the arms be wiggly/become wiggly. My ideas were to use either a shader or a skinned mesh to solve this, but I ran out of time to figure it out :(
